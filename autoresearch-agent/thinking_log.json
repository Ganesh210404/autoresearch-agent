    "data": "**Answer:** After 10 years, AI is likely to have a profound impact on software jobs, both positively and negatively. While AI may automate some tasks, it is expected to create new opportunities for developers and software companies, leading to an expansion of the software development market. The future of software engineering will be shaped by the interplay between human creativity and AI-driven productivity. As AI assumes more routine and repetitive tasks, software engineers will focus on high-level problem-solving, innovation, and complex application development.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* AI is expected to automate tasks reliant on \"codified knowledge,\" which may lead to a decline in employment for early-career engineers (ages 22-25) in AI-exposed roles. This is evident in a Stanford study, which reveals a 13% relative decline in employment for early-career engineers in AI-exposed roles. (Source 2)\n* Senior roles in software engineering are likely to remain stable or grow, as AI struggles with the \"tacit knowledge\" of experienced engineers. This suggests that senior engineers will continue to play a crucial role in software development, leveraging their expertise to guide AI-driven projects. (Source 2)\n* AI is expected to enhance productivity, leading to more hiring in the software development industry. According to Morgan Stanley Research, the software development market is likely to expand at an annual rate of 20%, rising from $24 billion in 2024 to $61 billion by 2029. (Source 3)\n* The role of traditional software engineers is likely to shift to more complex applications, as AI assumes more routine and repetitive tasks. This will require software engineers to develop new skills, such as AI programming, data analysis, and machine learning. (Source 3)\n* New opportunities for developers and software companies will be created as companies build increasingly complex applications. This will lead to the emergence of new job roles, such as AI engineer, data scientist, and software architect. (Source 3)\n* The use of AI coding assistants and agents will become standard tools in development workflows, enabling software engineers to focus on high-level problem-solving and innovation. This will lead to a shift in the software development process, with AI assuming more routine and repetitive tasks. (Source 3)\n\n**Contradictions / uncertainty:**\n\n* The Stanford study mentioned in Source 2 suggests a 13% relative decline in employment for early-career engineers in AI-exposed roles, while Source 3 suggests that AI will create new opportunities for developers.\n* The impact of AI on software jobs is likely to vary depending on the specific role, industry, and level of experience. For example, AI may have a more significant impact on junior engineers in AI-exposed roles, while senior engineers may continue to thrive in the industry.\n* The future of software engineering will depend on the ability of software engineers to adapt to the changing landscape, developing new skills and expertise to work effectively with AI.\n\n**Citations:**\n\n* https://www.sundeepteki.org/advice/impact-of-ai-on-the-2025-software-engineering-job-market\n* https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-software-development-industry-growth\n* https://brainhub.eu/library/software-developer-age-of-ai (not directly cited, but referenced in the sources)\n\n**Confidence:** 85\n\nThe confidence level is 85 because the sources provide a clear picture of the potential impact of AI on software jobs, both positively and negatively. While there are some contradictions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the impact on early-career engineers, the overall trend suggests that AI will have a significant impact on the software development industry. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of AI on software jobs and to develop strategies for software engineers to adapt to the changing landscape.\n\n**Why:** The confidence level is 85 because the sources provide a clear picture of the potential impact of AI on software jobs, but there are some inconsistencies and uncertainties that need to be addressed. The future of software engineering will depend on the ability of software engineers to adapt to the changing landscape, developing new skills and expertise to work effectively with AI."
